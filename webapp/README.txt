DATA: A dataset of around 45,000 movies along with lots of specific metadata.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working features:

	-Main page (navigates to any of the four data pages)
	-Search page (all filters should work, results are displayed with ID's (for testing purposes)
	-Popularity (sort-by criteria working for movies, directors, actors)
	-Comparison (non-detailled option displays budget, revenue, and runtime for each movie)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What needs to be done:
	
	-Need to add help hover buttons for all pages
	-Need to rework Popularity page completely, we are turning it into a random movie generator
	-Comparison needs datalists for both inputs and more comparative criteria
	-Popularity needs proper queries for production companies, genres, languages, and countries
