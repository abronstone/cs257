DATA: A dataset of around 45,000 movies along with lots of specific metadata.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working features:

	-Main page (navigates to any of the four data pages)
	-Search page (all filters should work, results are displayed with ID's (for testing purposes)
	-Popularity ()
	-Comparison

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What needs to be done:
	
	-Need to add help hover buttons for all pages
	-Need to rework Popularity page completely, we are turning it into a random movie generator
	-Comparison needs datalists for both inputs
	-Popularity needs proper queries for other metadata besides movies
